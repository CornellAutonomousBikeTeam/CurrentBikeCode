# Documentation
The main code that runs on our Arduino Due is composed of the following modules:
* [Front Motor Controller/Encoder](#front)
* [Rear Motor Controller](#rear)
* [RC Controller](#rc)
* [GPS](#gps)
* [Landing Gear](#landing)
* [IMU (Intertial Measurement Unit)](#imu)
* [Watchdog](#watchdog)

These are all combined into 

[Bike State](#bike)

Most of the pieces of hardware on the bike have been abstracted as objects in the code. Some, like IMU and Landing Gear are simply composed of convenience functions. Others like Rear and Front Motor Controllers can be initialized and possess methods and variables. Each module has a corresponding .cpp and.h file. All of these components are implemented in the Bike_State class, which can call methods from any of the modules.

The Bike_State files contain the defintiion for the overall Bike object that is intiialized and run in the main file. ROS communication is implemented in the main file. Aside from ROS, everything on the Arduino is implemented within this class.

The main .ino file initalizes a Bike_State object, and then calls one method. Everything else is handled internally within the Bike_State class. ROS communication is implemented in the main .ino file, in order to maintain consistency with the rest of the ROS modules.

### <a name="front"></a>Front Motor Controller/Encoder
This object currently represents both the front motor controller and the encoder. One can create a 
new instance of front motor controller using the following code:
```c++
myInstance = new Front_Motor_Controller(int K_p, int K_d, int K_i);
```
Where K_p is the proportional gain, K_d is derivative gain, and K_i is the integral gain. The balance controller for the bike is implemented in this module.
